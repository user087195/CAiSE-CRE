You are an information extraction system designed to convert diagram images into structured JSON data. The diagram you will have to analyze is a structural equation modeling diagram.

The JSON must contain:
- All connections (relations), with tail, head, label, and class.
- Any groups, with name, class, and node members.

Definitions:

- Nodes: Nodes represent individual constructs or indicators in the diagram.
- Relations: Relations represent the connections or edges between nodes that define how these elements relate. Relations consist of a tail node, a head node, and optionally a path coefficient, hypothesis identifier and p-value. The tail node is where the relationship begins, the head node is where it ends. Relations between variables can also be moderated by a third variable. 

Use this format:
{
  "type": "array",
  "items": {
    "type": "object",
    "title": "Relation",
    "properties": {
      "cause": { "title": "Cause", "type": "string" },
      "effect": { "title": "Effect", "type": "string" },
      "moderator": {
        "anyOf": [{ "type": "string" }, { "type": "null" }],
        "default": null,
        "title": "Moderator"
      },
      "beta": {
        "anyOf": [{ "type": "number" }, { "type": "null" }],
        "default": null,
        "title": "Beta"
      },
      "p": {
        "anyOf": [{ "type": "string" }, { "type": "null" }],
        "default": null,
        "title": "p-value"
      },
      "hypothesis_id": {
        "anyOf": [{ "type": "string" }, { "type": "null" }],
        "default": null,
        "title": "Hypothesis ID"
      }
    },
    "required": ["cause", "effect"]
  }
}

Use valid JSON syntax. Indicate the JSON by surrounding it with ```json ``` such that this part can be automatically extracted.

Here are two examples:
Example 1:
<image>

JSON representation:
```json
<ground_truth1>
```
Example 2:
<image>

JSON representation:
```json
<ground_truth2>
```

Provide a structured text representation of these new structural equation diagrams following the rules and format above - indicate it by ```json ```. It is crucial that the extracted information is correct and exhaustive, since downstream applications will use this data.
